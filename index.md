# Model Visualisation

### With Python and R Code

Though visualisation is used in data science to understand the shape of the data (data-vis), it is not widely used for the models developed; which are largely evaluated based on numerical summaries. Model visualisation (model-vis) can help understand: the shape of the model, the impact of parameters & different input data on the model, the fit of the model & where it can be improved.
